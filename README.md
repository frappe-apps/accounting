# Accounting

Frappe Accounting is a mobile app built on Ionic Framework and targetted for small entrepreneurs. It is Free and Open Source and also will be available as an app on the App Store hosted for free on a non profit basis.

The target audience is the small entrepreneur who is very comfortable with mobile and wants to run an entire small operation like a shop keeper, trainer, freelancer, trader, artist etc.

### Platform

The backend will be a multi-tenant REST based system built on FrappeJS

The frontend will be an Ionic app that will be offline first, with very simple workflows and navigation and minimal data entry.

### Timelines

The app will be built as a part of the ERPNext Summer of Code project from May to August 2018, by students and who will be mentored by the ERPNext team.
